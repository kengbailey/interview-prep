Arrays

- Arrays are objects which can store collection of same type of elements
- An array has a certain number of elements in a fixed order
- Arrays are objects,and are created on the heap, not the stack
- Big-O Complexity of operations Access Θ(1), Search Θ(n), Insertion Θ(n), Deletion Θ(n).
-- 'n' represents no. of elements in array. And it means search operation is  
--- slow as we need to iterate all elements in array to search for one specific element
- Arrays are static, which means that we cannot change the size of array once created.
- We always subtract -1 from array length to point to the last index location.

JAVA EXAMPLE
dataType[] arrayRefVariable = new dataType[arraySize];

GOLANG EXAMPLE
var myArray [3]int 
myArray := [3]int{1,2,3}

PYTHON EXAMPLE
myArray = [1,2,3]
